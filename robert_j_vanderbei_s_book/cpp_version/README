Simpo compilation notes:


simpo, without ampl interface, using eta matrices for basis factorization,
and employing 2 phase simplex method:

        common/noamplio.c

        simpo/2phase.c
        simpo/lueta.c

        common/cputime.c
        common/hash.c
        common/heap.c
        common/hook.c
        common/iolp.c
        common/linalg.c
        common/main.c
        common/solve.c
        common/strdup.c
        common/tree.c

exchanges:

    using one phase primal-dual simplex method instead of 2 phase method:

        as above except simpo/2phase.c is replaced with simpo/pd.c

    using basis refactorization instead of eta matrices:

        as above except simpo/lueta.c is replace with simpo/lurefac.c

    using AMPL interface instead of MPS files:

        as above except common/noamplio.c is replaced with:

                common/amplio.c
                ampl/*.c
